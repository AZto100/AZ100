  <b>Overview of tax accounting:</b><br>
  Accounting refers to the keeping of records, of how value and money moved in company accounts over time. For instance, maybe money is transferred from the savings account to the credit card account. Or maybe money was paid to a provider for merchandise, then money leaves our bank account, but merchandise takes its value in our inventories. The following data is stored to keep track of these changes:<br><br> General <b>Journals</b> vs. General <b>Ledgers</b>: An Overview<br>
When it comes to tracking the finances of a business, a double-entry accounting system that uses both a general journal and an automated general ledger is arguably the best method for tracking a company's overall financial data and keeping operations running smoothly and profitably.
<br>In order to truly understand how such a system of accounting works, first appreciate the different functions associated with two key components: general ledgers and general journals.<br>
<br>KEY TAKEAWAYS
<br>The <b>general journal</b> contains accounting entries that <b>record business transactions</b>, in sequential order by date. It records who i.e. what account, paid who an amount (and dates, Notes and such). The <b>general journal</b> is the <i>only storage or data that is needed to run a complete accounting system</i>. The following <b>general journal</b> is sufficient for most companies:<br>
<table style = "width: 90%;"><p>
        <th>Index</th><th>Amount</th><th>Debit Account</th><th>Credit Account</th><th>Date</th><th>Description</th><th>Class</th><th>Reference</th><th>Source</th><tr>
<th>1.</th><th>R2000</th><th>paid to Bank</th><th>from Susan</th><th>on 21 April 2024</th><th>Starting capital</th><th>Financing</th><th>F0001</th><th>POP</th></p>
</table>
<p style="background-color:rgb(232,232,232); color:#60223b; margin-left:8px; ">The general ledger tracks five key accounting items: assets, liabilities, owner's capital or equity, revenues, and expenses.<br> The <b>general ledger should be automated from the general journal shown above.</b><br> 1. If money (or value) is paid (or moved) into any <b>Asset account</b>, that asset account is the <b>debit or left-position</b> account in the General Journal. The account paying or providing the value is the <b>credit or right-position</b> account in the General Journal.<br>
2. For <b>Income statement, Liabilities and Owners' Equity accounts</b>, these are increased on the <b>credit or right-position</b> in the General Journal and reduced using <b>debit or left-position</b> entries in the General Journal.<br><br>
Basic Business Models show how most companies focus on profits. Many businesses also have other motives such as social contributions etc. In general though, there are only 3 business activities:<br>
1. Raising Money i.e. - <b>Financing Activities</b> -<br> 
2. Buying and selling Assets i.e. - <b>Investing Activities</b> - and<br>
3. Using Assets to earn profit i.e. - <b>Operating Activities</b> -<br><br>
Companies get <b>1. finance or assets</b> from <b>owners, loans and retained earnings</b>. Owners include Venture capital and shareholders, since they each own part of the business.<br>
They <b>2. invest the money</b> (financing) in assets such as Machines, Property and Equipment and also spend it on training or things such as materials and inventory.<br>
The assets and human resources are then used for the <b>3. operations</b> of the business,
generating sales and profits.<br>
<b>Net Profit or Net Income</b> is either used to pay dividends to owners or kept as <b>Retained Earnings for financing</b>.<br><br>
A company has ASSETS i.e. things it owns or money in their bank accounts. It is vital to understand that <b>everything the company owns</b> come from <b>Liabilities or Owners' Equity.</b> The company LIABILITIES are shown in debt accounts that must be paid over time. Similarly, Owners Capital is a type of debt against the company. The <b>actual value</b> of the company is in <b>Retained Earnings and in future profit</b> potentials.<br><br> 
Financial statements show the business activities and the financial performance of a company. The following list contains some principles that apply to statements: <br>Consistency, Permanence and Comparability (apply the same accounting methods and principles consistently over time)<br>
<b>Matching principle</b> (expenses should be recognized, [i.e. placed in the Income statement] in the <b>same period</b> as the revenues they help generate)<br>
Full disclosure principle (include all of the necessary information)<br>
<b>Accrual principle or Revenue/Expense recognition principle</b> (revenues and expenses should be recognized [i.e. placed in the Income statement] when they are earned or incurred; <b>NOT</b> when the cash flow happens!)<br>
Materiality (any item that may impact the decision-making process of an investor must be recorded)<br>
Conservatism (be pessimistic, record future possible losses but not future gains or revenues)<br>
Going concern principle (assumes that an entity will continue to operate for a long time)<br>
Cost principle (requires assets and liabilities to be recorded and reported at their original cost)<br>
Economic entity principle (transactions of a business should be kept separate from those of its owners and other businesses)<br>
Objectivity principle (use factual, verifiable, and objective data; NOT opinions)<br>
Reliability principle (accurate and relevant information in accounting records using proven evidence that the transactions exist. Examples proof are invoices, purchase receipts, bank statements etc.)<br>
Good faith and Sincerity (expectation of honesty and completeness in financial data collection and reporting)<br><br>
<b>STATEMENTS<br>
<br>Statement of financial position (SOFP)</b><br>
The Balance Sheet or SOFP is a <b>snapshot</b> at a point in time. On the top half (or sometimes left side) is the company's assets and on the bottom half (or right side) its liabilities and Shareholders' Equity (or Net Worth).<br> The assets and liabilities are typically listed in order of liquidity with TOTALS of CURRENT and NON-CURRENT.<br>
Amounts shown in the SOFP are often duplicates of the same money! For instance if there is R1000 in the Bank Account and R1000 in Retained Earnings (and no other amounts) then its the same R1000 in both accounts. The company got the R1000 as profit from a previous period, and thus retained earnings is where the money came from, while the actual money is in our bank account!<br>
<br><b>Income Statement or Profit and Loss Statement</b><br>

The income statement covers a <b>period of time</b>, such as a month, quarter or year. It illustrates the profitability of the company from an accounting (accrual and matching) perspective. It starts with the revenue line and after deducting expenses derives net income or profit.<br><br>
The <b>cash flow statement</b> looks at the cash position of the company. It answers it answers the questions ; How much of the organisation's cash goes to its creditors and shareholders? Does it keep enough for its own investment and growth? It has 3 components: 1. cash from operations, 2. cash used in investing, and 3. cash from financing. It removes all of the accounting principles and shows the cash flows of the business.<br><br>
<b>Depreciation</b> on tangible assets and 'Amortization on non-tangibles*' are seen as expenses to the company. Because Profits = Revenue - Expenses, this allows a company to pay less tax and make a fair profit. The reason for depreciation is that a company may not record the Cost of an asset directly as an Expense when they buy the asset. They record the lowering of value over time as depreciation according to fixed rules.

VAT (Value Added Tax) on the sale of a business property:<br>

Registered VAT Vendor (Seller):<br>
If the seller (owner of the business property) is registered for VAT purposes, the purchase price of the property will include VAT.
The VAT amount is payable by the buyer and is calculated based on the agreed-upon purchase price.<br>
Zero-rating<br>
It is also a possibility that if a VAT vendor sells a property, which forms part of his or her enterprise, to another VAT vendor that the sale can be sold as a going concern and zero-rated for VAT purposes i.e. VAT is levied at 0%. This would reduce the cost of the property for the purchaser (although he or she would have been able to claim the input in any event - it essentially helps with cash flow). In order for a sale to be a going-concern for VAT purposes there are a number of requirements that need to be met. Some of these are:<br>

The seller and purchaser must both be VAT vendors;<br>
The property must consist of an enterprise or part of an enterprise that is capable of operating separately;<br>
The parties must agree in writing that the supply is a going concern;<br>
The parties must agree in writing that the enterprise is an income-earning activity on the date of transfer;<br>
The assets necessary for carrying on the enterprise must be included in the sale; and
The parties must agree in writing that the sale includes VAT at the zero-rate.<br>
A common example in the case of the sale of immovable property is the sale of commercial premises that is currently being let. Such a sale may be zero-rated if all the requirements are met.<br><br>
Non-Registered VAT Vendor (Seller):<br>
If the seller is not registered for VAT purposes, then transfer duty applies instead of VAT. Transfer duty is a tax payable by the buyer when acquiring the property and is paid directly to the tax authority.<br>
Unfortunately, you cannot claim back the transfer fees (or depreciate them) on buying a property, however they are included in the base cost of the property and therefore will reduce the capital gains tax payable when you sell the property one day.<br><br>
Transfer duty is not applicable on the first R1 000 000.<br>

Transfer duty is calculated incrementally for property acquired on or after 1 March 2020 as follows:<br>

R1 000 001 to 1 375 000: Pay 3% on the value above R1 000 000<br>
R1 375 001 to R1 925 000: Pay R11 250 + 6% of the value above R 1 375 000<br>
R1 925 001 to R2 475 000: Pay R44 250 + 8% of the value above R 1 925 000<br>
R2 475 001 to R11 000 000: Pay R88 250 +11% of the value above R2 475 000<br>
R11 000 001 and above: Pay R1 026 000 + 13% of the value exceeding R11 000 000<br>
<br>
If you buy a potato (as a basic foodstuff you do not pay VAT which means you have no VAT expense) to make food for your restaurant, you used the potato (and added labor and overhead during the process) in your service and your product does now attract VAT.<br>
Taking clients to a restaurant is called 'entertainment' and you can claim it as a business expense, but NOT the VAT on it. However, if you are going out for a meal with a client and are out of town for longer than one night, you can claim the VAT back on this. You can claim VAT back for any foods while you are out of town on business for a period longer than one night.
You cannot claim VAT for everyday things like tea and coffee provided by the workplace. However, for any food or drinks for delegates that you are training, Vat can be claimed.<br><br>
Computer equipment, vehicles, properties and other assets that the company aquires form a VAT vendor; then you are able to claim the VAT on the purchase.<br><br>
For monthly or quarterly statements: Calculate the Profit before tax and tax provision for the month. Enter the Tax Expense on the Income Statement as a Debit, and Credit the Tax provision account (a liability) without paying the tax. That way, when you actually pay the tax to SARS, you just Debit the Tax provision account (saying we do not have the debt anymore) and Credit (paid from) your Bank account. Provision accounts are estimates for payable accounts, i.e. once the final tax is to be paid is known, you could debit the provision to zero and credit the tax payable account. But if the amounts are correct per month, this is not required and can be explained. If for instance a previous quarter tax provision was too high, than a tax adjustment could be shown (in the final quarter when tax is due) to balance the over-provision on taxes. This adjustment amount would be <b>Credited</b> to Tax Expense (meaning it is a tax reduction, since tax payments are Debited!).<br><br><br>
*Amortisation on non-tangibles in South Africa:<br>
Calculate the Tax Amortisation Benefit (Expense) of an intangible asset?<br>
Amortisation of intangible assets are not all tax deductible. Its deductibility depends on the corporate income tax legislation of countries.<br>
In South Africa, only patents are allowed to amortise at 5% per year for 20 years.
Other intangibles such as Technology,	Trademarks,	Customer relationships and	Goodwill are not allowed any tax benefits! See paragraph (o) of Article 11[1] of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 for details.
