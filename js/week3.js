window.transEB1 = ["0. Week3, April 2024: In this tutorial I provide the solution to you in the text, and you need to rewrite that to transactions in a general journal. After that you must calculate the totals of all accounts from the journal as given, and then transfer those totals to the 'Statement of Financial position' and 'Income Statement'. Then, calculate the tax you need to provide for and update the statements. You only need to do this on paper, and if you want to check your calculations, enter them in the A0100 app.<br>The text will be grouped in logical chunks that you need to understand as a unit. This means that you read the text, and then I give you the required transactions that go along with that logical unit. Assume SB treats VAT as a separate book and all amounts exclude VAT i.e. ignore VAT for this tutorial.","1.
